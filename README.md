# EVM

A virtual machine written in C.

The documentation is currently a work in progress, so if you have any questions, please ask in the repo discussions.

## Contribution

Any PR is welcome as long as you aren't making *too* big of a change. As in, this means do not change a whole function of the system without it being approved first. That being said, any tools or neat features are welcome as long as they are useful to the program.

## Build

To build:

```sh
./build.sh all
```

To clean:

```sh
./build.sh clean
```

The build system is currently a work-in-progress, however I do intend on sticking with the shell file.
